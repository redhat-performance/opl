MBU products perf&scale library
======================

OPL library
-----------

Contains various helpers for not only RHCloud performance testing.

Generic command-line tools
--------------------------

There is couple of tools used mostly to integrate with CPT and comp.:

* `cluster_read.py` - Library (and command-line tool) to get data in a ways
  defined in a config file. It can execute command, read from Prometheus or
  Grafana. It is used by `status_data.py` to enritch status data files with
  facts (as defined in per-test config file). Usually it is info about
  the cluster (using `oc ... | jq ...` commands) or monitoring data from
  Prometheus. E.g. see `opl/cluster_read_example.yaml`.
* `pass_or_fail.py` - Tool which uses simple statistic in an attempt to
  decide if latest test result is PASS or FAIL when compared to historical
  results. Example of the config file is in
  `opl/investigator/sample_config.yaml`.
* `junit_cli.py` - Script to manipulate JUnit XML file from CLI. It is
  used by Satellite CPT.
* `status_data.py` - Library (and command-line tool) to manipulate status
  data files.
* `status_data_report.py` - Tool to render Jinja2 template with data from
  status data file. It is used by tests to provide final summary without need
  to write per-test tool which would do it - Jinja2 template seems to provide
  enough logick for what is needed in the output. Each test have its own
  template - e.g. see `opl/status_data_report.txt`.
* `status_data_diff.py` - Convenience tool to show differences in two status
  data files.
* Deprecated `data_investigator.py` - Tool which consumes input status data
  files and loads data from similar status data documents in ElasticSearch
  and decides if result in provided input status data file is PASS or FAIL.
  It counts some averages and so to do that. Currently it is used by
  Satellite CPT.

These tools are only used by tests:

* `script-skip-to-end.py` - Script to skip to the end of Kafka queues for
  given consumer group (it should be trivial given python-kafka docs, but
  simplest way did not worked for me)
* `script-manage-db.py` - Helper script to manipulate with utility DB.
  Consumes config with list of tables relevant for given test and SQL needed
  to create them. E.g. see `opl/sample-tables.yaml`

Installation
------------

Install with:

    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    python -m pip install git+https://github.com/redhat-performance/opl.git

If you have cloned the git and want to develop locally, replace last step with:

    python -m pip install --editable .

Running unit tests
------------------

    source venv/bin/activate
    python -m pytest
