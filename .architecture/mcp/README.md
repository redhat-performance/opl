### `configure_pragmatic_mode`
**Standard Command Equivalent**: "Enable pragmatic mode"

Enables and configures Pragmatic Mode (YAGNI Enforcement) to prevent over-engineering.

**What it does:**
1. **Configuration Management** - Creates or updates `.architecture/config.yml` with pragmatic mode settings
2. **Mode Activation** - Enables/disables the Pragmatic Enforcer in reviews
3. **Intensity Control** - Sets how aggressively complexity is challenged
4. **Deferrals Setup** - Creates deferrals tracking file if enabled

**Parameters:**
- `projectPath` (string, required): Path to your project root directory

**Creates/Updates:**
- `.architecture/config.yml` - Pragmatic mode configuration
- `.architecture/deferrals.md` - Deferred decisions tracking (if enabled)

**Behavior by Intensity:**
- **Strict**: Challenges aggressively, requires strong justification for any complexity
- **Balanced**: Thoughtful challenges, accepts justified complexity (recommended)
- **Lenient**: Raises concerns without blocking, suggests alternatives as options

**When Pragmatic Mode is Enabled:**
The Pragmatic Enforcer participates in:
- Architecture reviews (`start_architecture_review`)
- Specialist reviews (`specialist_review`)
- ADR creation (`create_adr`)

The Pragmatic Enforcer will:
- Challenge complexity and abstractions with structured questions
- Score necessity vs. complexity (target ratio <1.5)
- Propose simpler alternatives that meet current requirements
- Track deferred decisions with trigger conditions

**Example:**
```javascript
{
  projectPath: "/path/to/project",
  enabled: true,
  intensity: "balanced"
}
```

**Note**: This tool provides the same pragmatic mode capabilities available in Claude Skills via the `pragmatic-guard` skill.

### `pragmatic_enforcer`
**Standard Command Equivalent**: "Ask Pragmatic Enforcer to review..."

Invokes the Pragmatic Enforcer to analyze proposals, code changes, designs, or architectural decisions for over-engineering and propose simpler alternatives. This tool allows selective pragmatic analysis independent of whether Pragmatic Mode is globally enabled.

**What it does:**
1. **Load Configuration** - Reads current pragmatic mode settings (intensity, exemptions, thresholds)
2. **Provide Framework** - Presents structured analysis framework with key questions
3. **Guide Analysis** - Guides through necessity assessment, complexity assessment, and ratio calculation
4. **Template Output** - Provides structured template for consistent pragmatic reviews
5. **Context-Aware** - Adapts guidance based on review type and configured intensity

**Parameters:**
- `projectPath` (string, required): Path to your project root directory

  - `"proposal"` - Architectural recommendation or suggestion
  - `"code"` - Code changes or implementation
  - `"design"` - Existing design or architecture
  - `"decision"` - Architectural decision or ADR
  - `"implementation"` - Feature implementation plan
- `target` (string, required): The content to review (proposal text, code snippet, design description, etc.)
- `context` (string, optional): Additional context about current requirements, constraints, or problem being solved
- `source` (string, optional): Source attribution (architect name, file path, PR number, etc.)

**Output Provides:**
- Key questions framework (necessity, simplicity, cost, alternatives, best practices)
- Structured analysis template with scoring guidelines
- Complexity-to-necessity ratio calculation guide (target < 1.5)
- Recommendation options (Implement Now / Simplified Version / Defer / Skip)
- Intensity-specific guidance based on configuration
- Exemption checks for security, compliance, accessibility

**Review Types Explained:**
- **proposal**: Use for architectural recommendations from other architects or team members
- **code**: Use for reviewing actual code changes or implementations for over-engineering
- **design**: Use for analyzing existing architectural designs or patterns
- **decision**: Use for reviewing architectural decisions before documenting in ADRs
- **implementation**: Use for analyzing feature implementation plans or technical approaches

**Example:**
```javascript
{
  projectPath: "/path/to/project",
  reviewType: "proposal",
  target: "We should implement a microservices architecture with event sourcing, CQRS, and a service mesh for inter-service communication",
  context: "Current system is a monolith with 50k LOC serving 500 users. Performance is acceptable.",
  source: "Lead Architect"
}
```

**Benefits:**
- **Selective Application**: Use pragmatic analysis only when needed, without enabling globally
- **Structured Reviews**: Consistent framework ensures thorough analysis
- **Educational**: Helps teams learn YAGNI principles through guided analysis
- **Flexible**: Works with any review type - proposals, code, designs, decisions, implementations
- **Context-Aware**: Adapts to project's intensity settings and exemptions

**Note**: This tool can be used even when Pragmatic Mode is disabled in config.yml. It provides the analysis framework and guidance, allowing you or your AI assistant to perform pragmatic reviews on-demand.
